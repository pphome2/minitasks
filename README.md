Mini task manager in one webpage.

Mini:
- No need CMS, only use it.
- No user managment, only one passcode in config file.
- No need install, only copy to folder, and add rights for web users.

All data is stored in the "tasks" directory. Here is the "schema" 
file that contains fields in the spreadsheet (separated by 
the "|" character). Before the name of the field is "#", you can 
filter it in the field.

When archiving, a new file is created based on the date, which 
can be opened but can not be edited.

All displayed messages are in the "config.php" file, you just 
have to change it to that language ...

(Thanks Google Translate)
